1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  Props, or properties, are objects from a parent component that are passed down to a child component when the child component is invoked. While making a tic-tac-toe game I had a specific state within a parent component I needed a child component to know the value of. I passed the state to the child component from within the invocation. Once it was passed, I went to the child component and called the passed state using this.props.state.

  An implicit return in Ruby is that with the way the syntax is written, a return is understood and not needed to be explicitly stated in the intended return line. Methods are written like, "given this data, do this." Ruby looks at the developer's code and understands what portion of it it is expected to return.
